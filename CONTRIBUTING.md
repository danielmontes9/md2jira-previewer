## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **pnpm** >= 9 (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- **Git**

### Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/md2jira-previewer.git
cd md2jira-previewer

# 2. Install all dependencies (monorepo)
pnpm install

# 3. Run the web app
pnpm --filter web dev

# 4. Run tests
pnpm test

# 5. Type check
pnpm typecheck

# 6. Lint
pnpm lint
```

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a branch

Always branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-description
```

Branch naming convention:
- `feat/<scope>-<description>`  new feature
- `fix/<scope>-<description>`  bug fix
- `docs/<description>`  documentation only
- `refactor/<scope>-<description>`  refactor without logic change
- `test/<scope>-<description>`  adding tests

### 2. Make your changes

- Read `AGENTS.md` for architectural rules before touching any file
- **Never** add browser/React imports inside `packages/core/`
- Add or update tests for any logic change in `packages/core/`
- Run `pnpm test` and `pnpm typecheck` before committing

### 3. Commit your changes

This project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) via `commitlint`. An invalid commit message will be rejected.

```bash
# Valid
git commit -m "feat(core): add support for strikethrough"
git commit -m "fix(tables): escape pipe characters inside cells"
git commit -m "docs: add CLI usage examples to README"
git commit -m "test(core): add multiline table cell edge cases"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat(core)!: convert() now accepts options object

BREAKING CHANGE: second argument is now ConvertOptions"
```

### 4. Open a Pull Request

Push your branch and open a PR against `main`:

```bash
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

Fill in the PR template completely. CIs must pass before merge.

---

## Commit Convention

Format:
```
<type>[scope]: <description in imperative mood>

[optional body]

[optional footer: BREAKING CHANGE / closes #issue]
```

| Type | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New functionality |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Formatting, no logic change |
| `refactor` | Code change without feat/fix |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or fixing tests |
| `build` | Build system, dependencies |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks |
| `revert` | Reverting a commit |

Valid scopes: `core`, `web`, `tables`, `lists`, `headers`, `formatting`, `codeblocks`, `cli`, `ci`, `readme`

---

## Pull Request Process

1. Fill in the PR template
2. Ensure CI passes: `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`
3. Link related issues with `closes #123` in the PR description
4. Request a review  maintainer will review within a few days
5. Squash merge is used  your branch history is squashed into one clean commit on `main`

**PRs that will be rejected:**
- Changes to `packages/core/` with no tests
- Browser/DOM imports inside `packages/core/`
- Commits not following Conventional Commits
- Changes that break the `convert(md: string): string` API without a `BREAKING CHANGE` note

---

## Project Structure

```
packages/core/      Conversion engine. Pure TypeScript. No browser deps.
apps/web/           React web app. Can use browser APIs and React.
```

See `AGENTS.md` for full architecture documentation.

## Working with AI Agents

This project is optimized for AI-assisted development. If you use GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, or similar tools:

1. Point your agent to `AGENTS.md` for full project context
2. The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file is automatically loaded by GitHub Copilot in VS Code
3. The agent will follow the same coding standards described in this document

---

## Reporting Bugs

Use the [bug report template](https://github.com/your-username/md2jira-previewer/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). Include:

- Markdown input that causes the issue
- Expected Jira Wiki Markup output
- Actual output
- Browser or Node.js version

## Suggesting Features

Use the [feature request template](https://github.com/your-username/md2jira-previewer/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

## Security Issues

Do **not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
